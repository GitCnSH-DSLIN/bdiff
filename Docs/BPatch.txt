NAME

bpatch - apply binary batch


SYNOPSIS

bpatch [options] old-file [ new-file ] <patch-file


DESCRIPTION

bpatch applies a binary patch generated by bdiff.

old-file is the same file as used as the first argument to  bdiff. bpatch will
create a copy of the file given as second argument to bdiff in new-file by using
the information from old-file and patch-file.

If new-file is omitted, the old file is replaced with the new file.

bpatch will detect if the patch does not match old-file, or if the patch has
been garbled. Remember to transmit binary patches as binary files!

In case of an error, new-file will not be touched.


OPTIONS

-i PATCH-FILE,
--input=PATCH-FILE  -  Read patch from specified file. Use this instead of a
                       shell redirection to get binary output on an MS-DOS
                       system: bpatch does not contain non-portable hacks to
                       massage stdin into binary mode;
                    Shell redirection works fine in the Pascal implementations
                    on Windows.

-h,
--help               - Show help screen;

-v,
--version            - Show version number.
