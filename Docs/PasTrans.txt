NOTES ON THE PASCAL TRANSLATION OF BDIFF / BPATCH
________________________________________________________________________________


¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
BDiff
________________________________________________________________________________

v0.2.1 (pas)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This version of BDiff is a literal translation of Stefan Reuther's BDiff v0.2
and exhibits near identical behaviour to the C version. Differences are:

+ The Pascal translation is only suitable for use on Windows targets - it
  compiles to a Win32 console application and uses the Windows API.

+ When shell redirection is used in the original C version running under
  MS-DOS/Windows to create binary difference files, the shell can write CRLF
  whenever LF appears in the output. This modification does not occur in the
  Pascal version and therefore it a safe to output binary files using
  redirection meaning it is not necessary to use the --output switch.

+ The numeric parameter to the -m or --min-equal switches must be decimal
  (i.e. base 10). The C version also supports parameters in C-style hex or
  octal.

+ Windows version information is embedded in the executable file.


v0.2.2.2(pas)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Modified UBlkSort.pas with translation of bug fix provided by Stefan Reuther.
Also updated version information so that product number incremented to v0.2.2
and build number added to file version number.


v0.2.3.3 and later
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
From v0.2.3.3 the program broke its link to the C source and began develop
separately. See the ChangeLog.txt for details of changes.


v0.2.5.5 and later
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
A manifest was added to resources that instructed Windows Vista not to run the
program elevated. 

NOTE: There was no version 0.2.4 - this was skipped to keep in sync with BPatch.

BPatch
________________________________________________________________________________

v0.2.1(p)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This version of BPatch is a literal translation of Stefan Reuther's BPatch v0.2
and exhibits near identical behaviour to the C version. Differences are:

+ The Pascal translation of BPatch is only suitable for use on Windows targets -
  it compiles to a Win32 console application and uses the Windows API.

+ Patch files read via shell redirection in the Pascal translation are read in
  pure binary mode, removing necessity to use --input command line switch to
  read patch file that is required in C implementation on MS-DOS/Windows
  systems.

+ Windows version information is embedded in the executable file.

When only one file is passed on command the program attempts to update the file
in place but fails since it can't rename the temporary output file as the final
since this files already exists (i.e. it is the input file). The C
implementation also exhibits this behaviour.


v0.2.1.2(pas)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As v0.2.1(pas) except that version information's product number was updated to
v0.2.2 and build number added to file version number.


v0.2.3.3 and later
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
From v0.2.3.3 the program broke its link to the C source and began develop
separately. See the ChangeLog.txt for details of changes.

NOTE: There was no version 0.2.2 - this was skipped to keep in sync with BDiff.

v0.2.4.4
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
v0.2.4.4 of the program was renamed to BPtch and had its version information
modified due to Windows Vista flagging BPatch as requiring elevation. This was
simply because of the use of the word "Patch" in its file name and its version
information! The program reverted to its original name at v0.2.5

v0.2.5.5 and later
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The program was renamed back to BPatch. A manifest was added to resources that
instructed Windows Vista not to run the program elevated. This got round the
naming problem identified above and enable restoration to the original name.
