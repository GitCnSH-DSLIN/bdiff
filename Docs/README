About The Software
________________________________________________________________________________

BDiff.exe computes differences between two binary files. Output can be either a
somewhat human-readable protocol in plain text, or a binary file that is
readable by BPatch.exe.

BPatch.exe applies a binary patch generated by BDiff.exe to a file to recreate
another file.

See the files BDiff.txt and BPatch.txt in the "Docs" sub-directory for details
of how to use the programs.

BDiff.exe and BPatch.exe are derived from Stefan Reuther's bdiff and bpatch v0.2
and a later bug fix.

The original C source was translated into Object Pascal by Peter D Johnson and
the programs provided are based on updates of this code base.

The programs should run on any 32 bit version of Windows.

Installation
________________________________________________________________________________

Copy the provided executable files to the required location. No further
installation is required.

You may want to modify the Windows PATH environment variable to include the
location of the programs.

To uninstall simply delete the programs. They make no changes to the system. If
you changes the PATH environment variable you may wish to adjust this.

Source Code
________________________________________________________________________________

Pascal Source
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Pascal source code for the current versions of BDiff and BPatch is in the "Src"
sub-directory. There is a sub-directory for each application and another for
common code.

A makefile is provided in the "Src" subdirectory. Borland's MAKE program is
required to build the code. See the comments in makefile for make options.

The following tools are required to build the source code:

+ Delphi 7 (or later) is required to recompile the Pascal files. The makefile
  uses the Delphi 7 command line compiler, DCC32. Access to the Delphi 7 VCL is
  needed.

+ Borland's resource compiler is required to recompile resource files. The
  makefile expects BRCC32 to be available in the same directory as DCC32.

+ Version information is specified in a .vi file. They require DelphiDabbler's
  Version Information Editor (VIED) to translate the .vi file into an
  intermediate .rc file. VIED must be available on the path. You can the get the
  Version Information Editor from http://www.delphidabbler.com/vied.

Binary resource files are provided in the "Bin" directories. If you don't wish
to change these the pascal code can be recompiled without effecting resource
files by using MAKE pascal.

The source code is stored in a Subversion repository on assembla.com. View the
repository at http://code.assembla.com/htmlres/subversion/nodes. The current
development tree is stored in "trunk" while snapshots of releases from v0.2.6
are provided in the "tags" branch. Subversion users can access the development
tree at http://my-svn.assembla.com/svn/htmlres/trunk

C Source

The original C source code can be downloaded from
