About The Software
________________________________________________________________________________

BDiff.exe computes differences between two binary files. Output can be either a
somewhat human-readable protocol, or a binary file readable by BPatch.exe.

BPatch.exe applies a binary patches generated by BDiff.exe.

See the files bdiff.txt and bpatch.txt in the "Docs" sub-directory for details
of how to use the programs.

BDiff.exe and BPatch.exe are derivations of Stefan Reuther's bdiff and bpatch
v0.2 and a later bug fix.

The original C source was translated into Object Pascal by Peter D Johnson and
the programs provided are based on updates of this code base.

The programs should run on any 32 bit version of Windows.

Source Code
________________________________________________________________________________


Pascal Source
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Pascal source code for the current versions of BDiff and BPatch is in the "Src"
sub-directory (there is a sub-directory for each application).

A build script for each program (named Build.bat) is provided in the relevant
source sub-directory.

To recompile Pascal files the Delphi 7 command line compiler and the Delphi 7
VCL are required. It may be possible to compile the source using other Win32
versions of Delphi, but this has not been tested.

To recompile version information (.vi) files both the DelphiDabbler Version
Information Editor (v2.11 or later) and the Borland Resource Compiler (BRCC32,
provided with Delphi 7) are required. You can the get the Version Information
Editor from http://www.delphidabbler.com/vied.

Futher information about the Pascal translations can be found in PasTrans.txt
which will be found in the "Docs" sub-directory.

Binary resource files are provided in the "Bin" directories.
