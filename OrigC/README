Welcome to bdiff/bpatch,

`bdiff' can generate patches to binary files, much like `diff' can
generate patches for text files. `bpatch' is the appropriate
patch utility.

The programs should be rather portable, the only assumptions are
- it's possible to load a whole file into memory, and to malloc
  an array containing a size_t for each byte in the file. Easier
  said, you need a 32-bit system and won't use this program on
  more than 500MB files (if you have 3 Gig of RAM).
- fseek on binary files uses byte offsets.

Configure in the makefile, compile with maximum optimisation for
best results.

Have fun,
  Stefan Reuther <Streu@gmx.de>
