.TH BPATCH 1 "July 1999"
.SH "NAME"
bpatch \- apply binary batch

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.BI "bpatch [options] " "old-file " [ new-file "] <" patch-file

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBbpatch\fR applies a binary patch generated by \fBbdiff\fR.
\fIold-file\fR is the same file as used as the first argument to 
\fBbdiff\fR. \fBbpatch\fR will create a copy of the file given
as second argument to \fBbdiff\fR in \fInew-file\fR by using the
information from \fIold-file\fR and \fIpatch-file\fR.
If \fInew-file\fR is omitted, the old file is replaced with the new
file.

\fBbpatch\fR will detect if the patch does not match \fIold-file\fR,
or if the patch has been garbled. Remember to transmit binary patches
as binary files!

In case of an error, \fInew-file\fR will not be touched.
\fBbpatch\fR creates a temporary file first whose name is
\fInew-file\fR with the first letter of the filename replaced
with a `$'.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "-i \fIPATCH-FILE\fR, --input=\fIPATCH-FILE\fR"

to get binary output on an MS-DOS system: \fBbpatch\fR does not contain
non-portable hacks to massage stdin into binary mode;
.IP "-h, --help"
Show help screen;
.IP "-v, --version"
Show version number.

.SH "ADMINISTRATIVIA"
